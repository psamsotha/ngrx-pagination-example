# Node Express (TypeScript) Pagination Example

I was actually in the process of making a pagination example
using Angular and Ngrx for the frontend, but I ended up spending
a lot of time working on the backend, and by the time I was finished
with it, I didn't have that much time to do the frontend.

If you're interested, you still may find some goodies in the project
if you are a backend developer.
